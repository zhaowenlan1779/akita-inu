# Project Akita Inu
This is a toy implementation of the paper [Doubly Efficient Private Information Retrieval and Fully Homomorphic RAM Computation from Ring LWE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1703.pdf). This implementation almost exactly follows the paper, and is not intended, nor expected, to be practically useful.
